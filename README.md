##Description

This project is a random password generator. The program uses JavaScript to prompt the user to specify a password length (8-128 characters) and which types of characters they would like their password to comprise (numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters).

The user will answer 4 prompts asking about specific characteristics they would like their password. At the end of the whole process they will have a password that meets their own requirements.
